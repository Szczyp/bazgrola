It’s a new year already, and the snowy aura doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon. The festivities are behind us. I had drafted a rather ambitious plan for the day, and a bit of snowfall was certainly not going to thwart it. The main objective was to photograph the decaying Prussian railway infrastructure near the village of Czarne.

The starting point was Danowo, a tiny hamlet situated near three lakes: Długie, Przykop, and Zgniłe.

The trail led through the forest toward the village of Okrągłe. Along the way, I stumbled upon three unusual pine trees, each in a different phase of life.

The path twisted and turned between the lakes and, as it neared the village, began to open up on the left, revealing open fields blanketed by a thick layer of snow.

Okrągłe—along with the frozen lake, white and fluffy, sharing the village’s name—or perhaps the other way around—greeted me with a bout of barking from a dog. It quickly lost interest after the brief confrontation, so I suppose I wasn’t threatening enough to warrant further concern.

After a quick look around, I found a road sign pointing toward the final destination. It was just a stone’s throw away, with swamps on the right and clearings on the left.

Czarne looks picturesque in white.

 Unfortunately, it was getting late, so I decided to skip the early 20th-century railway installations and ski back immediately. On the return journey, I was no longer sheltered from the falling snow, and it showed. At one point, the snow cover became so thick that, combined with the diffused overcast light, the forest appeared otherworldly.

A few moments later, the snowfall stopped, and the low, soon-setting sun began piercing through the clouds. This side of the forest had been logged a few years earlier, judging by the young pines growing among the few old, tall ones left behind—some struggling to remain upright against the blowing wind, with no companions around.

I arrived back in Danowo after the sun had already slipped below the horizon, though not before there was still enough light to capture this cool shot of a lone tree.
